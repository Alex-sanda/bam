Quick Start:

    1.pull the short text dataset into ./dataset/
  
         <store in the form of ./dataset/pos.txt(neg.txt) is recomanded>
         
    2.pull the trained word2vec data matrix file into  ./
  
    3.python main.py 
 
 Implementation detial:
 
    --python 3.6.3
 
    --tensorflow 1.5.0
 
    --keras 2.0
 
 
 
 Notes:
    
    1.The size of NLPCC-ECGC dataset is rather big, so it is not provided it here. But you can download the dataset from :
    
    2.The size of word2vec data matrix file is also big, we provide it here:
